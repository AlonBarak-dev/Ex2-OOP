<br> #### 4.4 Directed_Weighted_Graph:
<br> This class represent a directed-weughted graph, the interface that tis class relay on is containing a road-system or a communication network in mind that helps the class to support a graph with large number of nodes (over 100,00).
<br> Our compact representation for the implementation of the graph is concluding two Hashmaps, one is for the vetrexes (nodes) of the graph which the key represented by the id of the vetrexes and the value is the actual vetrex (node), the second one is a Hashmap of Hashmaps with two keys when the first is the source vetrex and the second key is the destination vetrex, the value is the actual edge.
